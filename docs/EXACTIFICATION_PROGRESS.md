# 346-function exactification queue

**Queue snapshot date:** 2026-10-18
**Dashboard exactification refresh:** 2026-10-26

The progress page does not show a separate queue card. The 346-function exactification queue remains separate from 5,775 additional exact-byte records in `docs/data/exactification-functions.json`. These records contain the original 15 entries, 1,760 earlier merged records, and subsequent per-function batches through lot 56. The reviewed objdiff report is unchanged. The dashboard reconciles exact records and raw objdiff matches by function identity and counts overlaps once. GitHub PR state checked against the REST API and current `main` ancestry on 2026-10-26: code lots 24–56 are merged. Code PRs #5206, #5307, #5408, #5509, #5610, #5711, #5813, and #5913 are closed as merged; dashboard PR #5914 is also merged through lot 56 (merge commit `5eadda3cdb9b0ff865c4ca386a424bfbb2caa7ed`). The earlier dashboard update through lot 53 was merged in PR #5105.

The public function list contains only function IDs, addresses, sizes, and exact status. It contains no reconstructed source, game bytes, binaries, local evidence paths, or private hashes. The 346-entry queue remains a separate measure from the 13,676-candidate objdiff snapshot; the 5,775 additional records are not included in its denominator.

| Queue status | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Freshly revalidated exact passes | 346 |
| Recorded results awaiting fresh revalidation | 0 |
| Batch rows classified as nonexact | 0 |
| **Total batch** | **346** |

That is **346/346 (100%)** of this exactification queue revalidated; **0/346** await fresh validation. The 100% applies only to the defined 346-function queue, not to the whole game or the 13,676-candidate split inventory.

All 346 queue entries have a current static/build-diff exact pass. That 346/346 result applies only to the defined queue, not to the whole game or the 13,676-candidate split inventory. The `reconstructions/validation-index.json` remains the maintainer-reviewed acceptance record and has not been changed by this proposal.

## Verified batch results and current proposal

The candidate map records lots 43–56. This update proposes lot 57. Every code lot from 43 through 56 contains 100 functions; all selected functions passed their recorded static byte and named-candidate ObjDiff gates. GitHub API and `main` ancestry were checked on 2026-10-26: lots 43–56 are merged; lot 57 is this review proposal.

The three newest code PRs (#5711, #5813, and #5913) each passed GitHub public-contribution preflight. Lot 54 has 14 unresolved call instructions across 7 functions. Lot 55 has 271 across 99 functions; 99 new sources were added and one existing source preserved, with four C4100 warnings in that preserved source. Lot 56 has 217 unresolved call instructions across 95 functions; it preserves two existing sources. These unresolved destinations remain unknown. Lot 56 has 99 unmatched dashboard candidates and one fuzzy candidate; its 46.48% fuzzy similarity is candidate metadata, separate from ObjDiff.

The merged candidate-map addition for lots 54–56 contains 300 records totaling 101,126 bytes. The lot 57 proposal adds 100 rows totaling 31,475 bytes; it records 100/100 static byte-equality passes, 100/100 fresh x86 compile passes, 100/100 ObjDiff 100.00% passes, 100 exact contiguous Ghidra bodies, and zero unresolved Ghidra call sites within the selected functions. The proposed map now reports 5,775 additional exact-byte rows and **6,126 exact candidates / 1,328,117 bytes (57.8157%)** across the incomplete 13,676-candidate snapshot. The raw objdiff report still contributes 63 exact candidates / 811 bytes and a separate 0.6678% fuzzy measure. The independent 346-entry accepted-reconstruction queue remains 346/346. The public `validatedReconstructionCount` remains 0; the maintainer-only `reconstructions/validation-index.json` was not changed. These dashboard records establish static byte exactness and candidate ObjDiff only; they do not establish semantic C, formal ABI, Xbox linking, post-link XBE equality, runtime, or gameplay.

To refresh the page, update the sanitized function statuses, run `python tools/decompdev/build_dashboard.py`, review the generated preview, then commit the updated data and page changes. GitHub Actions validates the report and publishes the dashboard from the commit. Detailed C sources, binaries, target bytes, and local evidence remain outside this repository.
